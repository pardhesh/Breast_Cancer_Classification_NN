# Breast_Cancer_Classification_NN
This programm initailly imports dataset directly from the scikit-learn library.
Then it converts it into a proper dataframe.
The program will build a neural network with 15 epochs using TensorFlow library and fits the dataframe into it after splitting the data.
The final accuracy is 97.46% and represents the loss, val_loss, accuracy in the form of a graph.
